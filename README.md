# PG Life App – Modified Version

This repository contains a modified version of a project originally provided by **Mainflow**. Please note the following important points:

- **This is not the original project provided by Mainflow.**
- I have **modified and repurposed** the code for a different use case, specifically for a project titled **PG Life**.
- **Currently, the two applications (Mainflow's original and this PG Life version) are not connected**.
- In the future, I plan to **deploy this application independently** once further development and testing are complete.

## About PG Life Project

The PG Life project aims to provide a user-friendly platform to explore and manage PG accommodations. This application is being developed as part of my personal learning and enhancement goals.

## Current Status

- 🔧 Under development
- 🧪 Not deployed yet
- 📡 No backend connection to Mainflow's systems

## Future Plans

- 🚀 Deployment as a standalone application
- 🔗 Potential integration features
- 📈 UI/UX improvements

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – Core web technologies for building responsive UI
- **Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS** – For fast and mobile-friendly styling
- **React.js** (optional) – If you're using a modern frontend framework for better UI/UX

### Backend (planned for future)
- **Node.js with Express.js** – Lightweight backend to handle APIs and routing
- **Python (Flask / Django)** – If backend will be Python-based instead
- **RESTful APIs** – For client-server communication

### Database
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** – Relational database options for structured data
- **MongoDB** – If planning a NoSQL approach

### Tools & Utilities
- **Visual Studio Code** – Primary code editor
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and project collaboration
- **Postman** – For API testing and debugging
- **npm / yarn** – Package managers to handle dependencies

### Deployment (future goal)
- **Vercel / Netlify** – For frontend deployment
- **Render / Railway / Heroku** – For backend & full-stack deployment
- **Docker** – For containerization (if needed for scaling or deployment)

### Optional Add-ons
- **Firebase / Supabase** – For quick backend, auth, and hosting
- **Power BI** – If you plan to integrate any data visualization for host analytics

These tools provide a strong foundation for developing and scaling the PG Life application. The tech stack may evolve as the project grows.


Stay tuned for more updates as the project progresses.
